each new socket connects on a different port - this can be seen from the scope under 'client': ['127.0.0.1', 56564] - but this isn't HTTP port,
that's 8000 for all of them, I think once HTTP upgrades to WebSocket it assigns a new port

let socket = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8000");
socket.onmessage = (event) => { console.log(event.data); }
socket.send("ping");
