The text segment needn't start at 0x08048000. But that address is the default location of the text segment for ELF on x86/32 and thus, for most x86/32 binaries, the location of their executable code.

Why does ELF default to 0x08048000? Likely because it borrowed that address from the System V i386 ABI.

Why then did System V use 0x08048000? Because, by placing the text segment at that address and the stack just below it (but above 0x08000000), a process could consume only a single second-level page table. In other words, you've got to pick a default, and that address offers a potential performance win, as minimizing page table footprint means optimizing TLB hit rate.

Is there anything below 0x08048000? The stack might be below it, although there could very well be nothing. That address is only 128M.
